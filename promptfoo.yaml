      Below is a brief description of {{agent}}:
      {{base_desc}}

      Below are {{agent}}'s memories:
      {{memory}}

      Current address: {{address}}
      Current time: {{current_time}}

      {{previous_context}}{{current_context}}
      {{agent}} starts a conversation with {{another}}. The following is their conversation log:
      <conversation_log>
      {{conversation}}
      </conversation_log>

      <conversation_rules>
      {{agent}} should not repeat content already present in <conversation_log>.
      </conversation_rules>

      Based on the above <conversation_log> and <conversation_rules>, what will {{agent}} say to {{another}} now?
      Output strictly the following JSON format, and do not include any extra information:
      {
          "{{agent}}": <what {{agent}} says>
      }
